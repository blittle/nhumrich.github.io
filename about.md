I am a Software Dude, currently working as a DevOps Engineer for [Canopy](https://www.canopytax.com). I like to talk about Python, containers, and DevOps things such as Microservices and Continuos Delivery.

Bio:

I was always interested in Software. I wrote my first program in BASIC when I was 14 and, and a Tic-tac-toe AI in Python when I was 17. I then moved on to get my degree in Computer Science at Brigham Young University. After graduating, I worked for Amazon, or more specifically, AWS. Eventually, one of my college buddies pulled me back into Utah to work for a startup Canopy. Canopy is now where I reside focusing on microservices and rapid develpment.
